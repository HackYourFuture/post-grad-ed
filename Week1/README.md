## 1. TA1 Planning

When applying for jobs a company most likely will give you a technical assignment to do. Why? They want to test your skills.

For this practice, your mentor will assign a Technical Assignment for you to work on from [this list](./../technical-assignments/w1-w2) but before starting, you will need to **make a plan**. Learn more about that by reading these great resources:

- [Starting A Serious Web Development Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGGPTskb7c8)
- [The Creation of a Web Application](https://selftaughtcoders.com/creation-of-a-web-application/)
- [Technical Assignment Tips for HackYourFuture Graduates](https://github.com/riccardobevilacqua/technical-assignment-tips) (IMPORTANT!)

Once you read the above documents and started working on your planning for the first week, think also about a minimum of 3 additional features that you will add/code (on top of the basic requirements from the TA) next week.

Feel free to make a pdf file with graphs, or simply right a short story including which technologies you will use, what will be the basic requirements and which features you will add to it later on.

Once your planning is ready, share it on the Slack PGP channel, and be sure to get feedback from your mentor. Remember that a good planning is half the work :)

## 2. TA1 Code

At the end of the week, share the code and deployed app with your mentor and group on Slack. Be sure to test the app before sharing it! Finally, don't forget to ask for feedback (or a code review) from your mentor. That's the best way to improve your skills.

***ProTip:*** An absolute essential skill of a great developer is the ability to do code reviews. This will not only make you a better developer, but also a great colleague and mentor! Check [The Science of Code Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyL7mqwpZhk) and review your own code! Can you clean up your code even further before submission? [Here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/post-grad-ed/blob/v3/how-to-code-review.md) also an awesome guide on how to perform code reviews for HackYourFuture graduates and mentors!

## 3. Video 1

Make a video explaining one concept you've learned during the development of the project (or a concept that you want to practice). For instructions on how you can do this, check [here](./../how-to-record-concept.md). Once ready, please share the video with the slack group and ask for feedback from your colleagues! A good developer not only knows how to explain technical concepts, but they also know how to give and receive feedback!

***Be sure the video is in a format that can be played in slack or upload it to YouTube directly!***

## 4. Questionnaire 1

Every week you'll be answering some important questions you would possibly find inreal job interviews (or at least help you prepare for them). These questions are meant to challenge you and help make explicit what you want out of your career. The more you think about this and become aware of what you want, the better you'll do in an interview! The key is to be as honest and elaborate as possible. This means: take all the time you need to answer the questions.

The theme of [this weeks questionnaire](https://hackyourfuture.typeform.com/to/NYnztGB5) is: "Why do I want to be a software developer"?


***Important:*** Take you time to prepare and elaborate this questions. They will come in handy for the end of this program and for when you apply to jobs!
 
## 5. Learnings 1
 
Write a message with a minimum of 100 words including everything you've learned this week. Don't make it generic, like "I learned that it's important to always keep learning". Instead, make it specific to your learning process. For example, "I learned that authentication is needed to safeguard certain routes from public access". 

Once you are done, sharing it on Slack. Everyone is keen to see what you've done and learned this week!


## 6. JavaScript Cardio 1 (Optional)

In order to become good at using a programming language, it's important to know the syntax. The various versions. And the different ways these can be used to write useful programs.

In this section you'll get several exercises you can do to train your ability to use the language of JavaScript:

- [JavaScript Array Cardio Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB1ZC7czKRs)
- [.some(), .every(), .find() and [...SPREADS] — Array Cardio Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmRfyNg1lw)

## 7. Algorithms 1 (Optional)

Thinking algorithmically is an essential part of a developer's mental toolkit. But what is an algorithm?

> An algorithm is a specific set of steps that can be used to solve a (coding) problem.

From this we can infer that `thinking algorithmically` refers to **the ability of thinking in steps**. Applied to programming, it means:

- Splitting a problem up into smaller problems to solve easily.
- Translating the steps into code

You might think, "easier said than done!", and you are right. That's why we practice.

In the following links you'll find [several exercises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/) to practice your algorithmic thinking skills! Do at least 5 of them.

***Are you ready for [week 2](../Week2/README.md)?***
