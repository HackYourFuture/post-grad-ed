# Mentoring PostGrad Students

The purpose of the module is to prepare students for a job interview both in terms of soft and technical skills. They will repeat the fundamentals learned on our course (web application development, algorithmic thinking and technical communication) by doing different coding challenges and by working on real technical assignments.

## Your role:
As a mentor you will work closely with two graduates. Some of the activities of a PGP Mentor are:

- Reviewing student's explanations of technical concepts done through videos - 1 per week. 
- Helping students understand how to approach technical assignments. Check [this document](https://github.com/riccardobevilacqua/technical-assignment-tips) with tips and tricks we think are important.
- Reviewing their code. This can be done through a call with the 2 mentees (to save time), doing it directly on the code (as inline comments), or however you think is best. The important thing here is that the students can improve the quality of their code and learn from their mistakes.
- Having weekly calls with them to discuss their TAs and technical videos and motivate the students to take their assignments to the next level. Depending on the quality of their project, students can add it to their CV as a 'Personal Project'.
- Acting as a real employer/interviewer every time they submit their Technical Assignments giving feedback and interviewing the student.
- Assessing whether their mindset and attitude is improving throughout the 4 weeks
- Completing a [Performance review](performance-review-template.md) at the end of the program for each of your mentees and suggesting them ways to improve further.

## Each week, students have to deliver:

- A 5 minute long video in which they explain 1 web development concept, including self-written code examples.
- A technical assignment planning (only in weeks 1 and 3): Before starting to code their TAs they need to present an assignment planning (including technologies to be used, requirements and further features to be developed, etc).
- The technical assignment: At the end of week 1 (and week 3) they will deliver their Technical assignment with all its core functionality and requirements as stated in the exercise. On week 2 (and 4) they will re-sumit their TA but this time including 3 new features and the feedback given by you. 

Students will post the links to their assignments and videos in the #postgraduation channel so other students can also see and comment on the work.

## What you can cover on the weekly video calls:
	
### General
- What have you learned this week?
- What did you find difficult?
- How many hours have you coded this week?

### Video
- Can you re-explain the concept to me?

### Technical Assignment
- Do you know how to approach this assignment?
- How’s the progress going? Are you experiencing any obstacles?
- How can you improve this assignment in week 2 or 4 (and how can you impress an employer)?

## Giving Feedback
Please be critcial but constructive. The idea here is that the students improve.

### Video
- Are they explaining the concept correctly?
- Are they using a self-written code example?
- Could they use better language to describe things? If so, what would you change?

### Technical Assignment
- Are the requirements of the assignment fulfilled?
- Is the code clean?
- Is the app fully tested and functional?
- Can it be improved? How?

## Other notes:
- At the end of the 4-week practice, please send your mentee a performance review to share with him/her what’s going well and what could use improvement. Please share this also with the HYF team so we know how things are going with the student and if he/she is ready to be introduced to companies! You can find a template for that [here](performance-review-template.md). If you feel the student is not performing well, please communicate with the HYF team.
- Students are expected to spend between 20-40 hours in this practice to really make progress in the 4 weeks. If you don’t see this happening, please address it.
- Weekly deadlines should be always respected. Besides teaching students how to code and do technical assignments, we want to also teach them good communication and planning skills.
- Try to motivate the student not to only comply with the minimum requirements of the assignment but to do their upmost best. If the TAs look and work good, they can be part of their CVs which is crucial at this point, given that they do not have many projects to show their skills yet.
- This module can still use quite some improvement. Please do share your thoughts and ideas with the HYF team so we can make it better! Thanks for your help!
