# Job prep checklist

Hopefully this module has helped you solidify the fundamentals for you. The next step is going out to apply for jobs. But before we do so, we need to double check to see if you've got your stuff straight!

Here's what we need to look at:

1. Web Development Fundamentals
2. Personal Motivation + Preference
3. CV + LinkedIn

## 1. Web Development Fundamentals

Before you even try a job interview, it's very important that you have a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts. Here's an overview:

```md
[] JavaScript fundamentals (basic syntax, event loop, OOP)
[] Form validation
[] HTTP
[] Synchronous versus asynchronous
[] Authentication & authorization
[] Client-server model
[] The role of JSON (parse, stringify)
[] API routing/client-side routing
[] Database modeling
[] Frontend state management
[] Code modularization
[] Working with external services/APIs
```

You need to have mastered all of these. You must be able to:

- explain each concept clearly and concisely
- write it out in code
- understand how each concept relates to another

As long as you're not able to do so there's still work to be done!

## 2. Personal Motivation + Preference

Like knowing the fundamentals, it's important to get your motivation right. Can you easily explain why you would like a developer job? Saying "I like programming" is not good enough, because it doesn't mean anything. Knowing how to make applications is just a means to an end: for you to do what you love and earn a nice living, and for the company to better achieve their goals.

Before you apply to jobs you need to start thinking about 3 fundamental questions:

1. What kind of sector would I like to be part of?
2. What type of developer would I like to be?
3. Why would I want to work at a particular company?

### 1. What kind of sector would I like to be part of?

Being a developer means much more than just writing code. You will be the one, together with other developers, that will realize the products and services of a company. This company operates in a certain sector: health, finance, law, or something else.

In the Netherlands liking the sector the company operates in is just as important as being able to do the job.

Sure, you might like programming but ask yourself: what sector would you like to work in? Is it health, finance or law? Or something simpler, like food, sleep or watching tv?

If you like the sector the company operates in, you'll enjoy the work much more. Research has shown that you will be working at least one third of your life. That's a lot of time! Do you want to spend those hours being unhappy?

Besides your personal happiness, your enjoyment of work will also affect your colleagues. And they don't want to work with someone that doesn't want to be there.

### 2. What type of developer would I like to be?

In the HackYourFuture program you've been exposed to all the sides of web development: frontend, backend and databases. However, not every side has been given as much attention as it deserves. You now might feel more skilled in frontend, as opposed to the rest. But you might like backend or database interactions much more!

I would like to propose to you to hold on to your natural interest!

Currently you are a junior web developer, and the company knows that. All they need to know is if you're willing to learn. For example, if you show a natural interest in backend, they are willing to invest in you learning it. This in turn will give you greater enjoyment and allow you to do the work more effectively. It's a win-win!

### 3. Why would I want to work at a particular company?

When applying to a job, you aren't just applying to a job. You are applying to a company, of which you want to become a part of.

Therefore, you should think long and hard about why you're motivated to be working at THAT particular company. This requires research. What type of products and services do they offer? What's they company vision and mission? Do they have core values they adhere to?

Look at all of these and form an opinion. Does it resonate with you? If so, this might be the place for you. Be sure to formulate arguments to describe why the company and you would be a good fit. Come up with at least 2 arguments.

### Summary

In summary, here are the things you should have figured out before you apply for jobs:

1. What sector would you like to enter: health, finance, law, etc.? Be able to explain it with passion.
2. What type of developer position would you like to specialize in: frontend of backend. Be able to explain it with passion.
3. Why you're passionate about a company's mission, products and services. Be able to explain it with passion.

## 3. CV + LinkedIn

The first thing an employer sees is your digital presence. What first impression do you give others?

### CV Checklist

The first thing to check is your CV. This is a document that describes your professional career: what education and work experience have you had?

Here are some questions you must be able to answer clearly for you to have a **professional** CV:

1. Are your personal details correct?

This is your contact information (name, address, email, phone number, etc). Make sure they're correct, as they are the best way to contact you!

2. Do you have a clear, short biography of who you are?

This is your pitch! What are you passionate about? How can you provide value to the business world?

3. Have you included relevant education, with a short description of what you learned?

This describes all the things that have shaped your thinking. What have you learned and how does it define your viewpoints?

4. Have you included relevant work experience, with a short description of what you did?

Your work experience shows future employers how experienced you are. If you don't have any experience in the field you're applying to, that's ok. Then mention in the description what it taught you.

5. Have you included the URL to your LinkedIn page?

Before you include your LinkedIn to your CV, make sure it is complete. Nowadays LinkedIn is a modern day CV, so make sure you've got the same content on there as you have in your CV.

6. Have you included the URL to your GitHub account?

If you apply for a developer job, this is a MUST. Before you even include the URL, it's best to clean up your GitHub. This means the following:

- Make sure your account includes at least 10 completed projects
- Write, in a README.md file, a proper description of each project's content. Include a screenshot of the application!
- Include a professional picture in your GitHub

After you've done all of this are you ready to put the URL on your CV.

7. Have you included a professional picture?

People would like to get to know you! Showing a professional look means that you take yourself seriously, which means others will do as well. Note: if you don't have such a picture, it's best to don't include any picture.

## Finished?

Have you checked off all the above? Great job! Now it's time to apply for jobs. Please send a message in the HackYourFuture Slack channel about your progress and contact the partnership manager.

Let's go get that big developer money!!!
