## 1. TA1 Final

This week you will develop the additional features to the TA1 which you already defined in your last week's planning. Additionally, we expect you to put focus also on the styling of the app. This TA will become part of your CV and is crucial that it not only works well but that it also looks good! Know that sometimes recruiters do not have a technical background, reason why they will also judge your projects based on their looks. This doesn't mean you should do design work, but you should be able to make the project look cool, maybe even add some exciting animations and always following [good UI practices](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/4-golden-rules-ui-design/).

Once you are done, test your app, cover the [best practices](https://github.com/riccardobevilacqua/technical-assignment-tips#technical-assignment-tips) and share the code and deployed version with your mentor and group on Slack. Again, don't forget to ask for feedback (and/or a code review) from your mentor and colleagues. That's the best way to improve your skills!

After the feedback, you hopefully now have solved your first real technical assignment AND you have another cool adition to your CV and GitHub. If you still want to make improvements to the app that's great, but leave it for after the PGP module as next week you will start working on a new assignment! Practice makes perfect :)

***ProTip:*** [Clean up your GitHub](https://medium.com/@sharonlin/cleaning-up-your-github-fedaf9e7cef2) and [make your profile great again](https://dev.to/pedes/make-your-github-profile-great-again-oan) with these amazing articles and [examples](https://github.com/kautukkundan/Awesome-Profile-README-templates).

## 2. Video 2

Make a video explaining a concept you've learned during the development of the project (or a concept that you want to practice). For instructions on how you can do this, check [here](./../how-to-record-concept.md). Once ready, please share the video with the slack group and ask for feedback from your colleagues!

***ProTip:*** Have you included any of the feedback you received on your last week's video? Is this week's video better than the last? Always try to take a moment to reflect if you are making progress and what that progress is exactly!

## 3. Questionnaire 2

This week we'll continue with [another set of questions](https://hackyourfuture.typeform.com/to/W7Nku0co), this time about you as a professional. Have you ever thought about your interpersonal skills in a professional context? What value could you add to a team or company?

## 4. Learnings 2
 
Write a message with a minimum of 100 words including everything you've learned this week. Remember to make it as specific as possible. Once you are done, share it on Slack!

## 5. JavaScript Cardio 2 (Optional)

We'll continue with more [JavaScript Cardio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2bJBuaOeOQ). You'll be doing several algorithm challenges. Code along with the instructor and play around with the solutions.

## 6. Algorithms 2 (Optional)

Let's continue with [more algorithm challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/). Like last week, try to solve at least 5 of them.

Do research, try to think step-by-step. And always remember that **there are multiple solutions to the same problem**.

***Are you ready for [week 3](../Week3/README.md)?***
