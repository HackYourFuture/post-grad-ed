## 1. TA2 Planning

Discuss with your mentor which TA from [this list](./../technical-assignments/w3-w4) you will work on now and **make a plan** for it. Don't forget to add the learnings from the following documents (same as the ones shared on week1 of the PGP) and to already add to you planning a minimum of 3 additional features to be developed next week:

- [Starting A Serious Web Development Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGGPTskb7c8)
- [The Creation of a Web Application](https://selftaughtcoders.com/creation-of-a-web-application/)
- [Technical Assignment Tips for HackYourFuture Graduates](https://github.com/riccardobevilacqua/technical-assignment-tips) (IMPORTANT!)

Once your planning is ready, share it on the Slack PGP channel, and be sure to get feedback from your mentor. 

## 2. TA2 Code

At the end of the week, share the code and deployed app with your mentor and group on Slack. Ask for feedback (and/or a code review) from your mentor.  Be sure to test it, to style it and to do your best. Same old eh :P

***ProTip:*** A very important developer skill is the ability to use and write documentation. Learn [how To use developer documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PLS3SQHQ0) and also [how to write effective documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6zeikbTgVc). Practice this new skill on your new TA and add it to the apps GitHub Repo!

## 3. Video 3

Make a video explaining one concept you've learned during the development of the project (or a concept that you want to practice) and share it on the PGP slack group!

## 4. Questionnaire 3

In [this week's questionnaire](https://hackyourfuture.typeform.com/to/h3rsXpWq) you'll be challenged to think about your aspiration as a developer. What type of developer would you like to be, and where do you see yourself working?

## 5. Learnings 3
 
Write a message with a minimum of 100 words including everything you've learned this week. Remember to make it as specific as possible. Once you are done, share it on Slack!


## 6. JavaScript Cardio 3 (Optional)

It's time for some more [JavaScript Cardio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfchU1FS2IA)! Follow the instructor and code along. A useful tip while learning is this: don't just brainlessly follow along. Instead, question what he's doing: why this way and not that way?


## 7. Algorithms 3 (Optional)

It's time for some more advanced algorithm challenges. These build on your skills gained from the previous week.

If it seems daunting, don't worry! You don't need to be a genius to solve them.

Here's the secret behind algorithm challenges: **they're actually solutions to common programming problems**. If you can learn, memorize and understand them, you'll become a great developer in no time!

Do at least 5 of the following [intermediate algorithms challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/).

***Are you ready for [week 4](../Week4/README.md)?***
