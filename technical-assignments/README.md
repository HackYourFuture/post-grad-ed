# Technical Assignments (TA)

Technical assignments are an essential part of the job application process. At first it might seem like a daunting challenge, but understanding the mechanics and learning the right approach will help you feel more relaxed about it. This in turn will help you increase your chance of getting the job!

**Important!** If you receive a technical assignment for a real job opportunity, please be sure to contact your mentor or Education Director. While they cannot do any of the code for you, they will help you make a plan, discuss the requirements and ensure that you do as well as possible on the assignment. 

## The why of TAs

Technical assignments are made for 2 main reasons:

- It's a simulation of the work you'll be doing for the company
- It gives the company an understanding of your skill set

All a company wants is to **find the right people, for the right job**. As a software developer they'd like you to write good software. Of course, you don't have to write a complete application to show them what you can do. They neither have the time nor the money to go through it.

Instead, they want to quickly see if you possess the skills needed to do the job. This is why the technical assignment exists.

In this folder you'll find references to various technical assignments. These are **real** assignments that **real** companies use to test job applicants.
