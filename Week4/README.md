## 1. TA2 Final

This week you will develop the additional features to the TA2 which you already defined in your last week's planning. Once you are done, test your app, cover the [best practices](https://github.com/riccardobevilacqua/technical-assignment-tips#technical-assignment-tips) and share the code and deployed version with your mentor and group on Slack. Again, don't forget to ask for feedback (and/or a code review).

***ProTip:*** `Unit testing` (or writing code that tests the functionality of individual "units or JavaScript functions" that make up your software) is a crucial concept for all devs to master. In this definition, a "unit" can be as simple as a JavaScript function. Chech this [JavaScript testing introduction tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9HdJ8P6GQI) and [get started with unit testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqeltCQP8c)!

## 2. Video 4

Make a video explaining a concept you've learned during the development of the project (or a concept that you want to practice) and share it on slack!

## 3. Questionnaire 4

The [final questionnaire](https://hackyourfuture.typeform.com/to/SoSrhfM9) of this practice is about your future. Looking forward, what goals will you set to build yourself a great career? These are important questions to think about. When you have the answer to them, you'll not only have more clarity about the direction your life is going, it'll give you more confidence going into job interviews!

## 4. Learnings 4
 
Write a message with a minimum of 100 words including everything you've learned this week. Remember to make it as specific as possible. Once you are done, share it on Slack!

## 5. Video Job Application

In this last exercise you are required to make a job application video. Nowadays, it's quite common to do this. It's also a great way to see how well you can present yourself. During the video, assume you are applying to your dream company and answer the following:

1. Who are you (what's your name, age, place of origin, etc...)?
2. What's your background (education, work)?
3. For how long have you been in the software industry and what brought you here?
4. What's the most recent software project you've worked on? (Provide a high-level explanation!)
5. What value could you add to a team (mention skills/attitude)? What makes you a good developer?
6. How excited are you about working for that specific company and why? (Research a company you want to apply to and make your content specific to that company)

Once you are done, upload the video to Slack. I guess by now you are a master in asking for feedback, so no need to remind you that :P

***ProTips:*** 
- Know the answers to the questions by heart and be confident about them.
- Write a script of what you want to say. However, when you're recording make sure you're NOT reading it! It should be as natural as possible.
- Rehearse several times before you make the recording.
- Make sure the video is of high quality.
- Record in a well-lit room that clearly shows your face.
- Have the video be at around 3 - 5 minutes.
- Add a few funny effects if you have the editing skills.

## 6. JavaScript Cardio 4

Are you getting the hang of it? The ability of using JavaScript is the same as any skill: the more you do it, the better you'll become! Follow along [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcoiPHktCwQ) and have fun playing around with some JavaScript functions!

## 7. Algorithms 4

If you've worked on the algorithmic challenges from this module, you might havve noticed that a big part of solving them requires to `transform one data structure into another` and then manipulating it appropriately using the correct methods. Have you came up with some other insights? Do at least 5 more challenges from [this list](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/) of intermediate Algorithms.

## Performance Review

Now that you have been working with a mentor for 4 weeks straight, he should have a good idea of how you performed and how you can improve moving forward based on his/her experience. Don't forget to ask your mentor for a performance review and (assuming you did a stellar job) a recommendation on LinkedIn! These usually impress employers!

Once you get your mentors review, share it with the HYF team so that together you can discuss the next steps to get an internship!

## Final Notes:

If you finished the program and you still havent found an internship or job, you can:

- Further practice your interviewing skills
- Do (or redo) all the optional material
- Further improve the TA's and add them to your portfolio / CV
- Work on the TA's that you didnt worked on before but that are also in this repo
- Start a [Fellowship Team](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/fellowship/) and work on some awesome projects!
- However, before you consider this module fully finished, be sure you master all the concepts in [this checklist](checklist.md).

It all depends on the feedback you have received in the last weeks. What should you focus on improving? What's most important at this stage?

Whatever that is, take a moment to also celebrate your successes! You are now a lot more prepared to succesfully apply for internships and/or jobs!

Congratulations :)
