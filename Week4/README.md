3. Developer skills: Unit testing
4. Technical Assignment II
5. Questionnaire IV
6. Video Job Application

### 1. JavaScript Cardio IV

Are you getting the hang of it? The ability of using JavaScript is the same as any skill: the more you do it, the better you'll become! Follow along with the instructor and have fun playing around with some JavaScript functions!

### 2. Algorithms IV

Let's continue with more intermediate algorithm challenges.

If you've worked on these challenges, you might've noticed this: a big part of these algorithms is merely `transforming one data structure into another` and then manipulating it appropriately using the correct methods.

Have you came up with some other insights?

Do at least 5 of the following challenges:

### 3. Developer skills: Unit testing

An important part of a developer's skillset is `unit testing`. Writing code that tests the functionality of individual "units" that make up your software. In this definition, a "unit" can be as simple as a JavaScript function.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about this topic. After you've done so, contact your mentor to see if they can help you set up some basic unit tests for your technical assignment.

### 4. Technical Assignment II

This is the final week you'll work on your technical assignment. Did you learn a lot?

Like previous weeks, have your classmate help correct your incorrect code by reviewing your code. The same thing you'll do with their code.

Good luck!

### 5. Questionnaire IV

The final questionnaire of the week is about your future. Looking forward, what goals will you set to build yourself a great career?

These are important questions to think about. When you have the answer to them, you'll not only have more clarity about the direction your life is going, it'll give you more confidence going into job interviews!

The theme of this week is: "Where do I see myself in a year?"

### 6. Video Job Application

In this last exercise you are required to make a "video job application". Nowadays, it's quite common to do this. It's also a great way to see how well you can present your self at this stage.

**VIDEO CONTENT**
What are you going to talk about in the video? You're going to answer the following questions:

1. Who are you (what's your name, age, place of origin)
2. What's your background (education, work)
3. For how long have you been in the software industry
4. What's the most recent software project you've worked on (provide a high-level explanation)
5. What value could you add to a team (mention skills/attitude)
6. How excited are you about working for the company? (Answer: VERY EXCITED!!!)

At the end of the video you should thank the viewer. That's it!

**TIPS FOR SUCCESS**
You might wonder how to best approach this, so here are some tips:

- Dresscode should be **smart casual**

- Know the answers to the questions by heart and be confident about them
- Write a script of what you want to say. However, when you're recording make sure you're NOT reading it! It should be as natural as possible
- Rehearse several times before you make the recording
- Make sure the video is of high quality
- Record in a well-lit room that clearly shows your face
- Have the video be at around 3 - 5 minutes
- Add a few funny effects if you have the editing skills
- BE EXCITED AND SMILE!

### Finished?

At the end of this week you need to deliver upon the following in the Slack channel [#postgraduationpack](https://hackyourfuture.slack.com/archives/C010LE1F9U7):

1. Write out in 100 words or less your number #1 key lesson you learned this week

   > Don't make it generic, like "I learned that it's important to always keep learning". Instead, make it specific to your learning process. For example, "I learned that authentication is needed to safeguard certain routes from public access".

2. A video explaining 1 concept you've learned about most about during the development of the project, find instructions [here](./../how-to-record-concept.md)

3. Finalize your pull request by pushing your final code for the technical assignment

4. Perform a code review on the pull request of one of your classmates. For instructions on how to do this, look [here](./../how-to-code-review.md)

5. The "video job application". It should contain the answers to the questions mentioned above, and presented in a clear and professional way

After you are done with all your submissions, you should start the performance review. You can find it here:

- [Performance Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X69WKezQn7X3TYW14RoV6RDiJM-G0HEhX7jT5ddDVo/copy)

 This will have valuable information on how you performed during this module and what can you do to improve moving forward.
