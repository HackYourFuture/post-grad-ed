# Postgrad Practice Week 4

## Agenda

1. JavaScript Cardio IV
2. Algorithms IV
3. Application Development IV

### 1. JavaScript Cardio IV

Are you getting the hang of it? The ability of using JavaScript is the same as any skill: the more you do it, the better you'll become! Follow along with the instructor and have fun playing around with some JavaScript functions!

### 2. Algorithms IV

Let's continue with more intermediate algorithm challenges.

If you've worked on these challenges, you might've noticed this: a big part of these algorithms is merely `transforming one data structure into another` and then manipulating it appropriately using the correct methods.

Have you came up with some other insights?

Do at least 5 of the following challenges:

### 3. Application Development IV

This week's the final quarter of the course. Have you enjoyed the process? While you might be very serious about getting a job, it's important to always keep in mind that `it's about the journey not the destination`. If you're not having fun while learning, you won't last long in the industry.

Polish up your remote repository, make sure the code base is clean and presentable. This is now another portfolio project you can show others!

### Finished?

At the end of this week you need to deliver upon the following in the Slack channel [#postgraduationpack](https://hackyourfuture.slack.com/archives/C010LE1F9U7):

1. A video explaining 1 concept you've learned about most about during the development of the project you're working on. Post the video in the Slack channel

Here are the requirements you have to fulfill:

- A general high level explanation of the concept: how + why
- A self-written code example that you analyse and explain step-by-step
- The video should include both your screen and your webcam view (we want to see your face!)
- It should be around 5 minutes

2. Write out in 100 words or less your number #1 key lesson you learned this week. Post the message in the Slack channel

> Don't make it generic, like "I learned that it's important to always keep learning". Instead, make it specific to your learning process. For example, "I learned that authentication is needed to safeguard certain routes from public access".

3. Submit your technical assignment from week 3 as a pull request to the repository. Post the URL in the Slack channel

4. Submit your codebase from the project you made in the "Application Development" section. Post the URL in the Slack channel
